6.011
http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-011-introduction-to-communication-control-and-signal-processing-spring-2010/
The essential prerequisites (not co-requisites) for this course are mastery of 6.003 and 6.041 (or equivalents), and of the 18.03 material related to solving linear, time-invariant systems of first-order differential equations using eigenvalues and eigenvectors. You should certainly not plan on taking 6.011 if you got less than a C in 6.003 or 6.041. If you did get a C (and maybe even if you got a higher grade than that), some further remedial work in the corresponding subject is important, starting immediately. If you are unsteady with 6.003, 6.041, or the relevant 18.03 material, you can be sure that 6.011 will expose that fact, sooner or later.

6.080
http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-080-great-ideas-in-theoretical-computer-science-spring-2008/
This course is designed for undergraduates (both under- and upperclassmen) in computer science and related areas of science and engineering. Others are welcome to take the course but might wish to discuss with the instructor. There are no formal prerequisites. The only prerequisite is some facility with mathematical reasoning: that is, the ability to construct valid mathematical arguments (including proofs by contradiction, induction, etc.) and to recognize errors in invalid ones. Such facility might be gained, for example, by taking 6.042. Programming experience is helpful but not essential; the course has no programming assignments.
----------
Practical Programming in C
6.087
http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-087-practical-programming-in-c-january-iap-2010/
This course assumes a basic understanding of the principles of programming. Prior knowledge of C is neither expected nor desired. The primary prerequisite of this course is 6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming , 1.00 Introduction to Computers and Engineering Problem Solving , 6.01 Introduction to Electrical Engineering and Computer Science I , or another introductory programming course at MIT. If you are unsure of the adequacy of your programming background, please speak to a member of the course staff as soon as possible. As the duration of this course is only three weeks, the material will be covered at a relatively fast pace, and catching up will be difficult.
